# Interviews With Technical Experts

Interviews with technical experts (as impersonated by ChaptGPT) on topics from science and technology.

## About

This project is an experiment with ChaptGPT (3.5) to explore technical non-fiction topics.

The goal is to learn a little bit more about specific technical topics (beyond Wikipedia) that are interesting (provoke my curiosity) and to learn how to better prompt ChaptGPT over time.

For each technical topic, ChatGPT is prompted to take on persona of an expert in the topic who is then interviewed for a general audience. The results are collected and turned into an essay in markdown format (listed below).

This project is an extension from ideas raised in the [Bad, Bad, Bad, Good](https://badbadbadgood.substack.com/) writing project.
